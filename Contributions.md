# Contributions

Any contributions are most welcome. Before doing so, please have a look below for background information on my own plans for the book as well the guidelines for making contributions.


## Current plans

My current plans for further development of the book are as follows:

- Create an additional fifth chapter that goes into the details of practical cryptographic applications, such as Tor, PGP, and VPNs. 
- Expand on the current four chapters with some more examples (e.g., a practical example of a stream cipher) and some further content (e.g., more details on AES)
- Create better and more figures and diagrams to support the written discussion
- Use LaTeX Math or some other typesetting application for the formal notation (rather than just Markdown) 


## Guidelines for contributions

This is my first attempt at writing a book in open source fashion. If you have some suggestions with regards to the workflow or the overall setup of the project, please raise an issue or contact me directly at **jaburgers@protonmail.com**.

If you have minor corrections or suggestions with regards to the existing text, you can create a pull request or raise an issue. If you create a pull request, please mind the following guidelines:

- Create the commits on a seperate branch in your fork of the repository
- Label the commits clearly
- Create seperate commits for logically distinct issues to make the review process easier

If you have more substantial suggestions with regards to the book, please raise an issue or contact me directly at **jaburgers@protonmail.com**.
